Ms Lee seems to be very strict at first, but as we got to know her, she is actually quite funny and relaxed. As long as we do not waste time walking 
to the venue and pay attention during lessons, she will not scold us. During the first PE lesson of the year, many of us took a lot of time changing 
into our PE attires, we were scolded for wasting the precious one hour we had per week. Hence, our first impressions of Ms Lee were not as positive. 
However, during a PE lesson where we had to decide between shotput and long jump, only a minority of us, including me, chose shotput, which Ms Lee was in 
charge of. She jokingly said that we were the "smartest amongst the whole class", as a small group meant that we would be able to finish the competition 
quickly and could be dismissed for recess early. Having fun and doing everything relaxingly, we still completed our tasks with around twenty minutes left. 
Ms Lee happily dismissed us and we had about an hour of recess, while the other group even had to delay their recess by ten minutes due to the large number 
of people in their group. From that hour of PE lesson, I realised that Ms Lee was not as strict as all of us had imagined.How a teacher was defined was not 
by how he or she was stern;on the contrary it was on how they taught us .
